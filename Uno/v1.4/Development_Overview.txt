Hardware development starting with v1.3:
Goals for v1.3:
-Verifying functionality of LED indicators.
-Finding the highest usable pulldown resistors for controlling MOSFETs.
-Testing effects of indicators on connected hardware.

Development results:
-Low gate capacitance on MOSFETs does not influence high-frequency operations.
-665k resistors are the highest that can mitigate static electricity on MOSFETs.
-Connected resistors do not interfere with tested analog measurements.

Quick turnaround prototype v1.4 continues development:
Goals for v1.4:
-Establish USB communication with IC and enable serial programming via USB.
-Prepare the board for multiple options of ICs.
-Basic schematic to begin user testing.

Development results:
-Established USB communication using TF232.
-Placement for ATMEGA328PB-AU and -MU; TF232 and CH340.
Problems:
   -Manual reset is needed after uploading program.
   -Apparent clock frequency changes randomly.
