Goals for v1.5:
-Fixing programming issues.
-Fixing clock frequency issues.
-Preparing board for global chip shortage.
-Changing Type-C connector to THT high tolerance
-Changing power jack to THT high tolerance

Development results:
-Changed board connectors.
-Changing to CH340 for later development due to global chip shortage.
-Permanent ATMEGA328PB-AU for later development.
-Fixed programming issues using v1.4 development boards with added external circuitry:
-> Permanent fix for v1.5 with adjusted fuse settings.
-> Fuse settings for later versions:
      HIGH: FF
       LOW: DE
  EXTENDED: F5
-External 16MHz crystal
-Boot start address: $3F00
-Serial programming enabled
-Brown-out detection: 2.7V
