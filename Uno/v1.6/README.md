## Notice for v1.6 pinout
Due to a manufacturing fault, the labels indicating A6 and A7 pins on the board are flipped. 
A6 marked on the board is A7 and A7 marked on the board is A6. Version 2.0.2 of the IDE package 
addresses this issue, so you can refer to those pins as they are labeled. This labeling issue 
will be resolved in the next version of the board while the pinout of the v1.7 boards will not 
be changed, only the labeling, providing pin compatibility across the versions.
