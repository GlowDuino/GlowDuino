## GlowDuino Microcontroller Family
This is the GitHub page for [GlowDuino](https://www.glowduino.com/) microcontrollers. Here you can find additional information about the hardware and software involved with the project, that is not available on the arduino.cc website. Just check the version number on the back of the board and open the corresponding folder.

### Status: Entering large-scale production
The GlowDuino microcontroller family is under constant development. The Uno variant is now finalized and in limited production. The first version to enter large-scale production is v1.7. and **soon will be available in the GlowDuino store at [glowduino.com](https://www.glowduino.com/).**
Development continues on the Uno board while work on other variants starts.

### How to install boards in Arduino IDE software:
For a detailed walkthrough, please see the instructions in the **Software and Installation** folder.

### Programing GlowDuino boards:
GlowDuino boards have new features that have no equivalent in the Arduino IDE. For more info on how to use these features, take a look at the **Users guide** folder.
